# Experiments

A testbed for experimenting with various technologies I'm interested in.

## Vagrant

Vagrant is eventually going to be used for testing everyting else.

## Ansible
Ansible will be used to set everything up.

## JOOQ
The database we are using for tests is called dvdrental and can be found 
[here](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/).


## TODO:
- [ ] Figure out how to have Maven read the db password and host from the env.
